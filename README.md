# Event_driven_theme_park_scheme

This is an event-driven simulation of an attraction at a theme park such as Disneyland.
At some theme parks, you can pay an extra fee and get priority access to different attractions. We could use this
simulation to determine the best way to set different aspects of our park, such as:

1. how much to charge for the priority access (charging more means less people will buy the priority access);
2. how often the attraction should accept new riders (more “runs” of the ride can result in higher operating
costs and increased likelihood of breakdown);
3. how many non-priority riders should be allowed on a run even when priority members are waiting (too
many means priority riders get upset and too few means non-priority riders may never get to ride);
4. etc…
